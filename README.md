# Onesearch

Onesearch is an addicting twist of the classic word search game. In this game, only the letters of the word are used as a part of the grid and the word appears only once in the grid.

Made for fun by two people who love building things and playing games.

The official app can be found on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=chrisjluc.onesearch)!
